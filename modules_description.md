## D4D-Minimal

This module provides a streamlined LinkML schema for essential, high-level dataset metadata, such as title, description, keywords, license, and version, captured in the <span style="color:green;">Information</span> class. It supports grouping multiple datasets via the <span style="color:green;">DatasetCollection</span> class and describing individual data resources with the <span style="color:green;">Dataset</span> class, including details like download URL, format, and size, while intentionally omitting detailed human-subject-specific elements.

## D4D-Human

This schema module uniquely addresses metadata specific to human subjects. Its core focus is on documenting privacy, consent, ethical review processes (e.g., IRB via <span style="color:green;">EthicalReview</span>), the identification of subpopulations, and the handling of sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) through elements like <span style="color:green;">SensitiveElement</span> and <span style="color:green;">Confidentiality</span>. It imports the main data sheets schema and defines or annotates classes such as <span style="color:green;">Person</span>, <span style="color:green;">Creator</span>, and <span style="color:green;">DataCollector</span>, along with properties detailing data acquisition (<span style="color:green;">InstanceAcquisition</span>, <span style="color:green;">CollectionMechanism</span>) and consent procedures (<span style="color:green;">CollectionConsent</span>, <span style="color:green;">ConsentRevocation</span>).

## D4D-Motivation

The unique theme of this submodule is to articulate the underlying reasons and funding sources for a dataset's creation, promoting transparency. It provides structured classes to capture this, including <span style="color:green;">Purpose</span> (why the dataset was created), <span style="color:green;">Task</span> (intended applications), and <span style="color:green;">AddressingGap</span> (the need the dataset fulfills). It also includes <span style="color:green;">Creator</span> to identify involved individuals/teams and their affiliations, and <span style="color:green;">FundingMechanism</span>, which details the <span style="color:green;">Grantor</span> (funding organization) and specific <span style="color:green;">Grant</span> information.

## D4D-Collection

This module is uniquely designed to capture detailed metadata specifically about the data collection process itself. It focuses on how data was acquired (<span style="color:green;">InstanceAcquisition</span>, <span style="color:green;">CollectionMechanism</span>), by whom (<span style="color:green;">DataCollector</span>), and under what conditions, including the <span style="color:green;">CollectionTimeframe</span>. A key part of its unique content involves ethical considerations directly tied to collection, such as <span style="color:green;">CollectionNotification</span>, <span style="color:green;">CollectionConsent</span>, <span style="color:green;">ConsentRevocation</span>, and <span style="color:green;">EthicalReview</span>.

## D4D-Composition

Focused on providing detailed insight into a dataset's structure and content, this module helps users assess suitability for tasks, including GDPR compliance. Its unique content covers what individual data points represent (<span style="color:green;">Instance</span> detailing topics, types, labels), descriptions of specific <span style="color:green;">DataSubset</span> or sub-populations, <span style="color:green;">SamplingStrategy</span>, documentation of <span style="color:green;">MissingInfo</span>, specification of <span style="color:green;">Relationships</span> between instances, definition of recommended <span style="color:green;">Splits</span> (training/validation/testing), notation of <span style="color:green;">DataAnomaly</span> (errors/noise), and listing dependencies on <span style="color:green;">ExternalResource</span>. It distinctively emphasizes elements like <span style="color:green;">Confidentiality</span>, <span style="color:green;">ContentWarning</span>, <span style="color:green;">Subpopulation</span>, <span style="color:green;">Deidentification</span>, and <span style="color:green;">SensitiveElement</span> within the context of dataset makeup.

## D4D-Preprocessing

This module's unique focus is on detailing the specific preprocessing, cleaning, and labeling steps applied to a dataset. It aims to inform consumers whether transformations performed on “raw” data align with their analytical needs. Key classes unique to this theme include <span style="color:green;">PreprocessingStrategy</span> (e.g., discretization, feature extraction), <span style="color:green;">CleaningStrategy</span> (e.g., instance removal, missing value imputation), <span style="color:green;">LabelingStrategy</span> (e.g., part-of-speech tagging), and <span style="color:green;">RawData</span> (indicating access to original, unprocessed data).

## D4D-Uses

The distinct purpose of this module is to encourage dataset creators to reflect on and document the intended and appropriate applications of their datasets, promoting responsible data practices. Its unique content provides clarity on how a dataset should (and should not) be used, through classes like <span style="color:green;">ExistingUse</span> (tasks already applied), <span style="color:green;">UseRepository</span> (links to papers/systems using the dataset), <span style="color:green;">OtherTask</span> (potential alternative applications), <span style="color:green;">FutureUseImpact</span> (potential risks/impacts of future uses), and <span style="color:green;">DiscouragedUse</span> (unsuitable tasks).

## D4D-Ethics and Data Governance

This module uniquely consolidates comprehensive documentation of both ethical considerations and the framework for data management and sharing. The ethics portion distinctly covers <span style="color:green;">EthicalReview</span> (institutional review processes), <span style="color:green;">DataProtectionImpact</span> (assessing risks to data subjects), <span style="color:green;">CollectionNotification</span> (how subjects were informed), and <span style="color:green;">CollectionConsent</span> (documenting consent procedures and revocation). The data governance portion specifically addresses how datasets are shared, licensed, managed over time, and what restrictions apply, through classes like <span style="color:green;">DistributionFormat</span>, <span style="color:green;">LicenseAndUseTerms</span>, <span style="color:green;">IPRestrictions</span>, <span style="color:green;">Maintainer</span>, <span style="color:green;">UpdatePlan</span>, and <span style="color:green;">VersionAccess</span>.
