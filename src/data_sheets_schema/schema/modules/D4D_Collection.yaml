title: "D4D Collection Subset"
description: >
  A LinkML schema subset for capturing how data was collected, including 
  who collected it, over what timeframe, whether consent was gathered, 
  notifications were provided, etc. Based on the “Collection” subset 
  from the full Data Sheets for Datasets (D4D) schema.

subsets:
  Collection:
    description: >
      The "Collection" subset focuses on who collected the data, how and when it was collected, 
      whether participants were notified or gave consent, and related ethical considerations.

  DatasetProperty:
    is_a: NamedThing
    description: >
      Represents a single property or aspect of a dataset.
