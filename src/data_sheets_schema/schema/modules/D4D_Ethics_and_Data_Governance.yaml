  This module combines ethics- and data-governance–related information 
  from Datasheets for Datasets. It covers topics such as ethical review 
  processes, consent procedures, data-protection considerations, dataset 
  distribution, licensing, IP and regulatory restrictions, as well as 
  maintenance and versioning plans.
