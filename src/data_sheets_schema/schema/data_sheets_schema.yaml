## SUBSETS ##
subsets:
  Motivation:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are primarily intended to encourage dataset
      creators to clearly articulate their reasons for creating the dataset and
      to promote transparency about funding interests. The latter may be
      particularly relevant for datasets created for research purposes.
  Composition:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are intended to provide dataset consumers
      with the information they need to make informed decisions about using the
      dataset for their chosen tasks. Some of the questions are designed to
      elicit information about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection
      Regulation (GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.
  Collection:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are designed to elicit information that may
      help researchers and practitioners to create alternative datasets with
      similar characteristics.
  Preprocessing-Cleaning-Labeling:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are intended to provide dataset consumers
      with the information they need to determine whether the “raw” data has
      been processed in ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks.
  Uses:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are intended to encourage dataset creators
      to reflect on the tasks for which the dataset should and should not be
      used.
  Distribution:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section pertain to dataset distribution.
  Maintenance:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are intended to encourage dataset creators
      to plan for dataset maintenance and communicate this plan to dataset
      consumers.
